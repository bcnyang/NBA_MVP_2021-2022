SQL Analysis of 2021-2022 MVP

Nikola Jokic and Joel Embid are two of the premier centers in the NBA, and the 2021â€“2022 season was no exception. I conducted exploratory data analysis to determine who deserved the MVP award. The data used for this project is primarily from basketball reference and ESPN respectively. I created four tables in Postgresql name MVP, embid_stats, nba_regular_season,  and nba_salary respectively, and then imported the data in.
